# plumegang
Little (early version) 2d game of a game coded in Python with Pyglet


### **DESCRIPTION**
You are a little rappeur in a new city to explore :

You begin in your own house and you need to earn money


Each day you lose some money and if you hit the 0$ bottom, this is a sad GAME OVER


In order to make money, you need to create and release 'sons' *(songs)*.

To create songs, you have to write some 'phases' *(lyrics)* in your bed with your 'plume' *(feather)*.

You also need to find an 'instru' *(instrumental)* and there you go !

**4 phases + 1 instru = 1 son**

Use the things in your house to make all this stuff !
